## Motive for This Project ✨  
- The main motive is to create a place where people can find almost every solution in tech in the easiest way.  
- The second motive is to give opportunities to newbie developers by giving them their own page to showcase their skills, portfolio, and many more things.  
- The third is to create a future-proof, safe, and creative site that isn’t only for knowledge or opportunities – for example, making your portfolio and showcasing it in a job interview as an admin of a big community. Isn’t that great?
